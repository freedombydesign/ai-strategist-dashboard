Headlines: ${JSON.stringify(website_intelligence.analysis.extractedMessaging?.headlines || [])}
CTAs: ${JSON.stringify(website_intelligence.analysis.extractedMessaging?.callsToAction || [])}
Page content: ${website_intelligence.analysis.competitivePositioning?.substring(0, 400) || 'Not found'}

I need to be BRUTALLY HONEST about Ruth's copy choices. Not gentle suggestions - real critiques that sting but help.

Examples of the brutal honesty Ruth wants:

"Ruth, 'Remove Yourself Without Revenue Dipping' - the word 'remove' makes you sound like a tumor. Your prospects don't want to be removed, they want to be elevated."

"'Everything Falling Apart' - you're literally painting a disaster scenario in your headline. This creates anxiety, not desire."

"'GET INSTANT ACCESS TO FREEDOM BY DESIGN' - this is marketing word salad. What the hell does 'Freedom by Design' actually mean? Your prospects have no clue."

"'This isn't for beginners' - lazy exclusion. Every guru says this. Be more specific about who it IS for."

I need to point out exactly WHERE her copy is failing and WHY it's costing her money. Be conversational but brutally direct about specific problems with her word choices.`
