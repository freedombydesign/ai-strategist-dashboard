# Sprint Step Tracking Test Plan

## Issues Fixed:

### âœ… 1. Database Schema Error Fixed
- **Problem**: `Could not find the 'M1_Q1' column of 'freedom_responses'`
- **Solution**: Updated `diagnosticService.ts` to use the correct `diagnostic_responses` table instead of non-existent `freedom_responses` table

### âœ… 2. Sprint Step Initialization Fixed  
- **Problem**: When starting a sprint, `step_number` was `null`, so AI couldn't track which step you're on
- **Solution**: Modified `sprintService.ts` to initialize new sprints with `step_number: 1` and `step_title` from the first sprint step

### âœ… 3. Enhanced AI Context Integration
- **Problem**: AI lost track of which action step you were working on
- **Solution**: Enhanced AI prompts with:
  - Clear step numbering (e.g., "ðŸŽ¯ CURRENT ACTION STEP: 1 of 12")  
  - Freedom Score sprint context integration
  - Progress tracking with completed/upcoming steps
  - Better fallback handling when step data is missing

## Test Steps:

1. **Take Freedom Score Assessment**
   - Complete the 12-question diagnostic
   - Verify it saves to `diagnostic_responses` table (not `freedom_responses`)
   - Check that you get recommended sprint sequence

2. **Start Your Top Priority Sprint**
   - Click "Start Sprint" on your #1 recommended sprint
   - Verify it creates a record in `user_steps` with:
     - `step_number: 1`
     - `step_title: "Getting Started"` (or first actual step title)
     - `status: "started"`

3. **Test AI Context Awareness**
   - Go to AI Strategist chat
   - Ask: "What step am I currently on?"
   - AI should respond with specific step number and context like:
     "You're currently on Step 1 of your 'Lock In Your Most Profitable Service Zone' sprint..."

4. **Test Enhanced Business Context**
   - Go through the enhanced Business Context Onboarding
   - Fill out the new fields:
     - Current workflow description
     - Biggest time waster
     - Perfect client experience vision
     - 3-year business vision
   - Chat with AI and verify it references your specific business context naturally

## Expected AI Response Format:

When you chat with the AI about your current progress, it should now say something like:

```
ðŸŽ¯ I can see you're currently on Step 1 of your top priority sprint "Lock In Your Most Profitable Service Zone" (your #1 recommended sprint based on your 43% Freedom Score). 

This step focuses on [specific step description]. Since you mentioned you're drowning in client delivery, this sprint is perfect because it will help you [specific connection to their challenge].

Let's break down Step 1 into smaller tasks you can complete today...
```

Instead of the generic responses you were getting before.

## If Issues Persist:

1. **Check Browser Console**: Look for any remaining JavaScript errors
2. **Clear Cache**: Hard refresh (Ctrl+F5) to ensure new code is loaded  
3. **Check Database**: Verify the `user_steps` table has proper data with `step_number` populated
4. **Test API Directly**: Check `/api/update-sprint-progress?userId=YOUR_ID` returns current sprint data

The enhanced system should now properly track your sprint progress and provide contextual AI coaching that knows exactly which action step you're working on!
